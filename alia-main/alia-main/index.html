HELLO 

<p>This Chocolate Cupcake recipe is my go-to for birthday parties and bake sales, since they are perfectly moist and oh-so chocolatey. Top them with our chocolate frosting, and you have the ultimate chocolate lover’s cupcake! </p>

<p>This chocolate cupcake recipe is moist and fluffy at the same time with a tender crumb. Adding coffee is the secret ingredient here, making these intensely chocolatey and giving the cupcakes a deeper color (and yes, you can sub with decaf coffee). You can’t really taste the coffee, and you probably wouldn’t know it’s there if you didn’t read the recipe, but it really makes the chocolate flavor shine. </p>


<ul>
<li>All-purpose Flour – Be sure to measure correctly for the best crumb.</li>
<li>Cocoa powder – Use naturally unsweetened cocoa powder for the best chocolate flavor and light, fluffy texture.</li>
<li>Sugar, baking soda, and salt – remaining dry ingredients, giving sweetness and rise
<li>Brewed coffee – warm regular or decaf coffee works perfectly. The acidity of the coffee deepens the chocolate flavor. Swap with room-temperature buttermilk if necessary.</li>
<li>White distilled vinegar – reacts with the baking soda for a better rise.</li>
<li>Vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla extract – remaining wet ingredients for moisture, strength, and flavor. P.S. If you are egg-free, try our Eggless Chocolate Cupcakes.</li>

<b>How to Make Chocolate Cupcakes</b>

<p>This recipe for chocolate cupcakes couldn’t get any easier, but the result tastes like it’s straight from the bakery.</p>

<ul>
<li>Quick prep – Preheat the oven with a rack in the center, and line a 12-count cupcake pan with liners (I love parchment paper liners – excellent for being non-stick).</li>
<li>Mix dry ingredients – In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt, breaking up any big clumps.</li>
<li>Mix wet ingredients – In a second bowl, whisk together the warm coffee, vinegar, oil, egg, and vanilla.</li>
<li>Combine cupcake batter – Pour wet ingredients over dry ingredients and whisk just until combined. The batter will be a little loose with small lumps. Overmixing can make the cupcake too dense.</li>
<li>Fill and bake – Fill each cupcake liner 2/3 full and bake at 350˚F for 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (do not overbake or your cupcakes will be dry). Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, and then transfer the cupcakes to a rack to cool before frosting.</li>
</ul>
